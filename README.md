# Advanced-Image-Processing-and-Color-Composite-Analysis-for-Remote-Sensing-Applications
Utilized MATLAB to generate False Color Composites (FCC) from RGB bands, enhancing visual interpretation of remote sensing data. Applied linear stretching and histogram analysis to improve image contrast and detail for accurate land cover differentiation. Employed Look-Up Tables (LUTs) to adjust color and brightness, optimizing landscape analysis.
